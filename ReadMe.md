**About Project**

The project, named The **ClickCraze solutions** Website, is a lead generation platform meticulously designed to gather potential customer information, facilitating effective follow-up by sales and marketing teams.

The project also includes a dedicated API endpoint for retrieving data in JSON format. With its modern design and responsive layout, this website not only efficiently captures leads but also showcases expertise in both front-end and back-end web development.
